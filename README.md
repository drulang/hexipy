hexipy
======

A command line learning tool to strength one's ability to perform mental hexadecimal conversions from/to any combination of hexadecimal, binary, or decimal. Primary focus is on A-F and being able to instanly recognize different forms.

I spend 2-3 minutes a day running through and it really has enhanced my ability to convert without having to think about it.

Modes:
  1. One-to-One : User chooses what units to use for conversion. Ex. dec->hex
  2. Random     : From/To units are chosen at random

Installation

  1. Add scoring system
  2. Add 0-9
